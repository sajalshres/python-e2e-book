## Why should you learn Python?

According to multiple sources (StackOverflow, Codeburst, TIOBE), Python is one of the ~~top 10~~ top 5 programming languages of 2019. Python, being a high level language, allows you to focus on the core functionality of the application by taking care of common programming tasks. It's dead simple syntax rules makes it easier to keep the code readable and maintainable. 

To sum it up:

- Readable and maintainable code
- Multiple programming paradigms
- Compatible with major platforms and systems
- Batteries included
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Open Source Frameworks and Standard Library

## What can you do with Python?

Python is a very versatile programming language, with a plethora of uses in a variety of different applications. There are so many applications of Python, but based on my observation, there are 3 main popular applications:

- Data Science: Data Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning
- Scripting
- Web Development

Other popular applications:

- GUI
- Database Programming
- Rapid Prototyping
- Image Processing
- Game Development

## Why is it called Python?

Guido van Rossum (Author of Python Programming Language) began implementing Python, who was also reading the published scripts from "Monty Python's Flying Circus", a BBC comedy series from 1970s.

## What are Python's strengths?

- It's free
- It's portable
- It's powerful
- It's easy to use
- It's easy to learn
- It's Object-Oriented

## So what are the downsides?

- It's speed
- It's not for mobile development
- It's heavy on memory consumption
- It's produces Run-Time errors
- It 's underdeveloped database access layer

## Is Python a scripting language?

Python is a general purpose programming language that is often used in scripting applications as well. The term "scripting" can have different meaning to different individuals.

## How does Python compare to language X?

Python is often compared to other languages like Java, JavaScript, Perl, Go, and even C/C++.

Summary:

- Cleaner syntax and simpler design
- Simpler and easier to user
- Powerful and cross-platform
- Is growing fast
- Performance
- Dynamically typed

## Python 3 or Python 2?

You should use Python 3 going forward. As of January 2020 Python 2 will be in EOL (End Of Life) status and receive no further official support. After that date, there will be no further updates nor bugfixes. Since this end-of-life date has been planned for nearly a decade (the first end-of-life date was slated to happen in 2014, and was pushed back to 2020), and nearly all popular libraries have already ported their code, Python 2.x is well on its way to obsolescence. As such, we can only recommend learning and teaching Python 3.

## Where is Python used?

Python is widely used by companies and developers to build web apps, automate operations in DevOps, Enterprise applications, data analysis etc.
